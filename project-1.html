<h1>Give You Glory</h1>
<p>The right side of the “W” is wider than the left side. Also, the outside left line is straight while the right is curved. The second loop is thicker than the first. And finally, the initial point of the “W” looks cartoonish while the second point is sharp and professional. </p>
